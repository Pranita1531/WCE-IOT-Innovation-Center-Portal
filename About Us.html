<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	What is IOT...</p></b>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a revolution in technology where all real world objects 
will be connected to internet. The Emerging technology is going to give a new dimension to 
way we perform our everyday activities. This system introduces the simple implementation of 
a usable application with the low cost solution.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) unites physical objects with the virtual world. 
devices and machines are connected to each other and the Internet. They capture relevant information 
about their direct environment, then analyze and link it. The devices perform specific tasks on that 
basis. A sensor, for example, measures the temperature outside and the smart device it is installed in 
responds by turning up the heating. All of that is done automatically, without users taking any actions 
themselves. Users can still control the IoT devices remotely if they wish, for example, using an app on their 
smartphone.</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	Features of IOT...</p></b>
<b>1. Connectivity :</b>
<P>Connectivity refers to establish a proper connection between all the things of IoT to IoT platform 
it may be server or cloud. After connecting the IoT devices, it needs a high speed messaging between 
the devices and cloud to enable reliable, secure and bi-directional communication.</P>

<b>2. Analyzing :</b>
<P>After connecting all the relevant things, it comes to real-time analyzing the data collected and
 use them to build effective business intelligence. If we have a good insight into data gathered from all 
 these things, then we call our system has a smart system.</P>

<b>3. Integrating :</b>
<P>IoT integrating the various models to improve the user experience as well.</P>

<b>4. Artificial intelligence :</b>
<P>IoT makes things smart and enhances life through the use of data. For example, if we have a coffee 
machine whose beans have going to end, then the coffee machine itself order the coffee beans of your 
choice from the retailer.</P>

<b>5. Sensing :</b>
<p>Sensing: The sensor devices used in IoT technologies detect and measure any change in the 
environment and report on their status. IoT technology brings passive networks to active networks.
Without sensors, there could not hold an effective or true IoT environment.</p>
       
<b>6. Active Engagement :</b>
<p>IoT makes the connected technology, product, or services to active engagement between each other.</p>
           
<b>7. Endpoint Management :</b>
<p>It is important to be the endpoint management of all the IoT system otherwise, it makes the complete
failure of the system. For example, if a coffee machine itself order the coffee beans when it goes to end
but what happens when it orders the beans from a retailer and we are not present at home for a few days, 
it leads to the failure of the IoT system. So, there must be a need for endpoint management.</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	The rise of the IOT all began with toaster...</p></b>
<p>The Internet of Things emerged as a technological infrastructure in the 2000s. Yet there was 
an everyday object that was able to transmit information on its status wirelessly before that: In 1982, 
computer science students in Pittsburgh, U.S., monitored how full a beverage vending machine was over 
the precursor to the Internet. The first connected home appliance followed in 1990, in the early days of 
the World Wide Web – even before the first website, which was launched 1991: The U.S. software and network 
expert John Romkey and the Australian computer scientist Simon Hackett connected a toaster to the Internet 
during a conference. It could be turned on and off online. That toaster is now regarded as the first-ever 
IoT device.</p>

<p>The term “Internet of Things” was coined by the British researcher Kevin Ashton back in 1999. 
The expert for sensor and identification technologies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
used it to describe passive RFID tags. RFID (radio-frequency identification) is a technology where a 
device can read and store data from a tag in a non-contacting manner. Here, too, physical objects were 
therefore connected with the virtual world, albeit in a narrowly defined area. A little later, in 2000, 
the electronics company LG presented the idea of an Internet refrigerator: It notifies owners when the cheese,
butter or eggs in it have run out.</p>
     
<p>Connectivity has expanded significantly since then: The network specialist Cisco calculated that 
by 2008 there were more devices connected to the Internet than people on Earth. That includes not only 
smartphones and computers, but all sorts of objects. More and more devices will be smart in the future: 
Around 75 billion devices worldwide will be connected to the Internet in 2025.
</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	Advantages & Application areas of the IOT...</p></b>
<p>Smart devices can now be found in private households, factories, vehicles, the healthcare sector 
and cities. Their aim is to make our everyday life easier and production processes more efficient, 
reduce power consumption thanks to greater efficiency, yet also help preserve the environment, optimize 
traffic flows or simplify life in megacities.</p>

<b>1. Smart home: </b>
<p>The lighting switches itself on and off in the evening, while smart electricity meters record 
and regulate power consumption: Various everyday objects are connected in a smart home – coffee 
and washing machines, refrigerators, thermostats or light switches, for example. The various devices 
are linked by means of a central control unit, termed a hub or gateway, and connected with the Internet. 
IoT devices can not only enable greater convenience and energy efficiency in the smart home, but also more 
safety: Connected surveillance cameras and smoke detectors, for instance, automatically pass information 
on to the user’s smartphone and directly contact the emergency services if needs be. Users can also 
control the light or music in the smart home, have the weather forecast or news read out to them or order 
goods online by issuing voice commands to digital assistants.</p>

<b>2. E-health: </b>
<p>Wearables, such as fitness wristbands, smart watches or fitness trackers, are worn on the body
and can record health data, such as your pulse or blood pressure. That data is analyzed by an app
and presented in the form of vivid charts or graphics. There are also already smart medical devices, 
such as pacemakers or blood glucose monitoring systems. If they detect a problem, they alert the user or
emergency services right away. E-health devices can thus ensure that the elderly or ill can live more
safely in their own four walls: Smart pill boxes ascertain whether patients have taken their 
medication or fall detection sensors in the carpet report if they’ve stumbled over. Connected medical 
devices are also used in hospitals: Smart beds supply information on the occupancy rate, for example. 
Results from the laboratory and measurements from various devices are then combined and automatically 
recorded at a central point.</p>

<b>3. Connected vehicles: </b>
<p>Most cars are already equipped with hundreds of electronic control units and semiconductors, 
including radar sensors. They measure speed and distance to determine how close another object or
person is. Since April 2018, every new car in the EU has also been fitted with “eCall,” an emergency
call system that can automatically summon help after an accident thanks to an integrated SIM card. 
Connected vehicles are also linked via WiFi or mobile communications, meaning drivers are notified 
about traffic jams, for example. Vehicles can also be serviced faster over the Internet and with the
aid of software updates over the air (SOTA) – without having to be taken to a workshop.</p>

<b>4. Smart city: </b>
<p>The UN predicts that two-thirds of the world’s population will live in cities by the year 2050. 
And by 2030 there will likely be 43 megacities with more than ten million inhabitants. That will pose
challenges, for example, in terms of infrastructure or air quality. Consequently, the cities of the
future must become more sustainable and safer so that our quality of life is enhanced. The buzzword
“smart city” subsumes ideas and concepts that are supported by connected technologies. They originate 
from diverse areas, such as energy, mobility, urban planning, administration or communication. Traffic 
lights then switch the required lane to green as soon as a fire engine or bus approaches. Streetlights 
switch themselves on and off as and when required or could ensure more safety with the aid of integrated
cameras. Digital systems control the infrastructure in local public transport, but also that of water, 
waste water and recycling systems. Administrative agencies can offer their services to citizens online to
save time and paper.</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	Challenges in IOT...</p></b>
<p>Many examples illustrate how smart devices in the Internet of Things help make our everyday life easier.
Yet they also entail diverse challenges that should not be ignored.</p>

<b>1. Big data and IoT Security: </b>
<p>The quantity of data collected worldwide is skyrocketing: Whereas 16.1 zettabytes were generated 
in 2016, that figure is expected to be 163 zettabytes – ten times higher – in 2025, according to IDC’s 
market researchers. Devices in the Internet of Things will account for a large slice of that. They collect 
vast quantities of data. And that creates challenges when it comes to protecting and securing data.
Whereas data security focuses on preventing unauthorized access to data, data protection involves 
safeguarding our privacy.New challenges are also arising when it comes to protecting data. 
The question is: What happens to all the data and where is it stored? The manufacturer of a fitness tracker,
for example, could create a precise user profile from the information collected and link it to other data. 
As in an industrial enterprise, the information has to be protected effectively against being accessed by 
persons. If not, there is the risk of the data being stolen: Criminals can also assume the 
identity of private users or specific employees and, for instance, access bank accounts or e-mailboxes.</p>

<b>2. Lack of compatibility and increasing performance requirements: </b>
<p>One further challenge for manufacturers of IoT devices is to develop multi-device and multi-platform 
applications. At present, sensors, platforms or operating systems often work only with specific systems.
The requirements demanded of a device’s individual components therefore vary. Ideally, it needs 
cross-platform hardware and software solutions, as well as specific software for particular applications.
The demands made of the devices are also increasing, which poses further challenges for manufacturers.
Sensors and semiconductors are expected to be more and more powerful, smart and secured and only have 
small latencies. Yet they should also use less power and be as small and inconspicuous as possible.</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	Infineon's contribution to the IOT...</p></b>
<p>It is vital for connected devices in the Internet of Things to be smart, energy-efficient and
protected. That’s only possible with technologies that semiconductor companies like Infineon have 
developed or driven. Sensors, for example, are the basis of the IoT, since they collect important data 
from their environment, whereas power semiconductors convert data into electronic signals and 
microcontrollers regulate entire systems.The diverse semiconductors made by Infineon are used in many 
areas of the IoT: The company’s LED technologies power professional lighting systems in smart cities, for
instance. Sensors and microcontrollers are used for smart infrastructure and transport systems, but also 
in the smart home. In Industry 4.0, not only special sensors, microcontrollers and power modules, but also 
security chips fulfill industry’s high requirements. They help protect systems and devices in the smart
factory against attackers. Infineon also equips connected cars, for example, with radar sensors.
Semiconductor technologies are also deployed for authentication and encrypted data transfer.</p>

<b><p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:18px">•	The future scope of IOT...</p></b>
<p>The Internet of Things will keep on growing. Connected cars will find the quickest and safest
routes in the future. Connected streetlights will record data on traffic, safety, lighting and even
the air quality. Connected air taxis will take people in cities from A to B. This development will
be driven by expansion of the new high-speed mobile network 5G, which enables faster and more stable 
data transmission. That will be a must, since the greater the number of devices that communicate 
each other, the greater the volume of data there will be. The 5G mobile network standard can cope with that
torrent of data and process it in the cloud.</p>

<p>Edge computing could also grow in importance moving ahead: IoT devices will then be able to process
data directly on the device where it is generated. That means data can be analyzed faster, for example,
in the connected car, than in the cloud. Artificial intelligence (AI) will also drive the Internet of 
Things. Computers and algorithms will then be able to handle problems on their own and become better and
better (“machine learning”). Four-out-of-ten industrial companies already use data analytics and AI for
digital product development. It is therefore likely that the Internet of Things will only be able to
unfurl its full potential when it is combined with artificial intelligence. Companies already learn
how to improve their products by analyzing data. </p>
